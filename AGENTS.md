# Standard Operating Procedure

## Coding style and conventions

Always follow all formatting rules defined in [`.editorconfig`](./.editorconfig) at the workspace root.
When generating or editing code, infer indentation, line length, and other style from .editorconfig instead of guessing.

## Architecture

The application consists of a frontend client, backend server, and database.
The frontend is a local-first PWA with full offline support.
